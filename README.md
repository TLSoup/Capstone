### About

I developed Fitly because I got tired of clothes not fitting and not having a good way of searching for a better fit. I also dreamed of being able to shop from any department and know that an article of clothing would fit, even when trying it on isn’t an option. 

Fitly lets you compare your measurements against those of real clothing so you can find what fits you, regardless of the number on the tag, or the department it came out of. Our database is constantly growing and being refreshed by users like you, making it the most accurate and up to date out there.

Shopping shouldn’t be so complicated. Sizing is subjective from one brand to another and can actually change from season to season based on marketing strategies. Yes, you read that right. Marketing could be to blame for your pants not fitting. Companies size their clothes based on how they would like their target audience to feel, either bigger or smaller, and this has been going on for so long that sizes really mean nothing. Plus if you actually do find something that fits really well, you are going to buy it again and again rather than search for another brand that fits. Clothing companies aren’t likely to give this up any time soon and opt for universal sizing, thus Fitly was born.

Fitly’s branding uses a font that calls upon both feminine and masculine with its soft and hard edges, which matches well with Fitly’s mission to provide you the information about what clothing will fit your body in a gender neutral way.  Colors are bright and energizing, to bring energy and excitement to a sometimes mundane process, and then paired with images that call upon more muted tones to create balance. 

Upon Logging in or creating an account, the user will be directed to their fit matches. They will be able to search for Tops, bottoms, dresses, one pieces like jumpsuits, rompers and onesies, and outerwear. They will have the option of going through the options that are presented in the order of best fit to least, or they can search for a specific brand that they would like to find their size in. There is a 3 star rating system that helps users determine their best fit. 

As I mentioned before our data about clothing is kept refreshed by the user, so the next thing I’m going to show you is how they will be able to add information about clothing items. 

They will be able to either scan the barcode on their recently purchased clothing items, or manually enter in information about the brand, style and size. From there the user can measure a few quick dimensions, press submit, and it will be populated into our database of clothing items. 

On the account page users will be able to see their current body measurements as well as their fit preference, as well as update it at any point. The benefit of having this information stored on your account is eliminating the need of remeasuring every time the user need or wants to add additional items into their wardrobe. 

The user also has the ability to update their username or password at any point. 
Fitly connects users to their authentic style without the headache that normally comes with shopping.
